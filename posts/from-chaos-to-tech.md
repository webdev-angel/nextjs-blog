title: 'From Chaos to Tech: My Journey'

In July 2021, I was a homeless single mother, working 3 part-time jobs, and living a highly chaotic life. Due to the COVID pandemic, **I'd lost two jobs** the year before; I only got one of those jobs back, and I'd secured another job to replace the second lost job. ***It still wasn't enough.*** I needed a change. And the change essentially fell in my lap; sometime in August 2021, after driving past Urban City Codes one busy day, I went home, reviewed their site, and submitted my application for tech courses.

My initial interest was in cybersecurity. Having had my own personal run-in with cybersecurity when I successfully manually removed a virus from my laptop, I'd developed a deep interest in that area. However, after being encouraged to try out the pre-coding bootcamp in which I learned HTML and CSS, I decided my interests were with coding.

Fast forward through a 16-week bootcamp in which I learned to build an **entire web application** using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I have ***three*** certifications. 

But it doesn't end for me. I am constantly learning new skills and adding more tools to my toolbag. I'm currently teaching myself **Python** and **ReactJS**.

It's been an amazing ride.
